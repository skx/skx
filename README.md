# Steve Kemp

Personal details:

* Location: Helsinki, Finland.
  * Nationality: British Citizen.
* Occupation: Sysadmin / Devops / Cloud-person.

Overview:

* I've been programming for over half my life, I'm comfortable creating, developing, maintaining, and improving software written in multiple languages
  * Including C, C++, Emacs Lisp, Perl, Ruby, Java, Shell, & TCL.
  * Most of my personal projects are written in Golang and Rust.
* My interests primarily revolve around compilers, interpreters, domain-specific languages, and virtual machines.
  * Examples of scripting languages include a [simple BASIC](https://github.com/skx/gobasic), a [simple FORTH](https://github.com/skx/foth), a [simple Lisp](https://github.com/skx/yal), and a [simple TCL](https://github.com/skx/critical/).
  * DSLs are great tools for automation, etc.
* I'm also interested in retro programming/projects, primarily based around the Z80 processor.
  * This includes Z80 assembly language programming, either for CP/M or the ZX Spectrum 48k.
  * For example [this CP/M emulator](https://github.com/skx/cpmulator), [the lighthouse of doom](https://github.com/skx/lighthouse-of-doom/) text adventure for the ZX Spectrum, etc.
